# Frozen Development Boilerplate

## Getting started

To get your environment set up, you need `node` and `npm`

Install [`volo`](http://volojs.org/) (requires 0.2.7)

```bash
> npm install -g volo
```

Then use `volo create` to start a new project

```bash
> volo create new_project iceddev/frozen-dev-boilerplate
```

## Development

During development, an error will be thrown because `dist/game.js` doesn't exist

However, we check to see if it is loaded and use the dojo loader if it isn't

We also note in the console that is happening

During development, work in the `src/` directory and make small modules

You can start a development server with linting and auto-reload using the `volo grunt` command in your terminal and opening `localhost:8000` in your browser

## Building

Once you are ready to deploy your project, you can build with the `volo grunt dojo` command

This command will crawl your dependency tree, starting with `src/game.js` and build a single file `dist/game.js.uncompressed.js`

It will also minify your file with Google Closure Compiler into `dist/game.js`

You shouldn't have to make any changes to your `index.html` for this file to start working

## Removing Build

You can remove the files generated by the `volo grunt dojo` (`dist/` and `libs/`) by running `volo grunt clean`
